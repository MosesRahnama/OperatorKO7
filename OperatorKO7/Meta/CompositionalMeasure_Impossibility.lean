# Compositional Measure Impossibility Theorem

This module defines a precise axiom system for "compositional measures" - termination
measures that compute the value of a compound term by aggregating the values of its
subterms - and proves that NO such measure can orient the duplicating recursor rule
`recΔ b s (delta n) → app s (recΔ b s n)` for all instantiations.

The module then shows that the Dependency Pair framework (TTT2's subterm criterion with
projection π(recD#) = 3) escapes the impossibility by violating the compositionality
axioms: it projects to a single argument instead of aggregating all subterm contributions.

## Structure

- **Section 1**: Helper: iterated `app` constructor (the "pump" for making μ(s) large)
- **Section 2**: `AdditiveCompositionalMeasure` - concrete Nat-weighted structure
- **Section 3**: Tier 1 impossibility theorem (additive measures)
- **Section 4**: `CompositionalMeasure` - abstract combining-function structure
- **Section 5**: Tier 2 impossibility theorem (transparent-delta case)
- **Section 6**: DP projection escape clause
- **Section 7**: Instance witnesses (simpleSize, tau, nodeCount)
- **Section 8**: `GlobalOrients` integration

## Key Results

- `no_additive_compositional_orients_rec_succ`: No additive compositional measure orients rec_succ
- `no_compositional_orients_rec_succ_transparent_delta`: No abstract compositional measure
  with transparent delta orients rec_succ
- `no_global_step_orientation_compositional_transparent_delta`: No abstract compositional
  measure with transparent delta globally orients full `Step`
- `dp_projection_orients_rec_succ`: DP projection DOES orient rec_succ
- `dp_projection_violates_sensitivity`: DP projection violates the subterm/sensitivity axiom

/-- **IMPOSSIBILITY THEOREM (Additive Measures)**

No additive compositional measure can orient the duplicating recursor rule
`recΔ b s (delta n) → app s (recΔ b s n)` for all instantiations of `b`, `s`, `n`.

**Proof strategy**: Set `b = void, n = void, s = appIter(w_delta)`. The RHS
`app s (recΔ void s void)` contains `M.eval s` TWICE (once directly, once inside recΔ),
while the LHS `recΔ void s (delta void)` contains `M.eval s` only ONCE.
The duplication adds `M.eval s ≥ w_delta` to the RHS, while the LHS gains only `w_delta`
from the delta wrapper. Since `w_app ≥ 1`, the RHS is at least as large as the LHS.

This subsumes all 12 failure witnesses in the catalog under a single theorem. -/

/-- An abstract compositional measure over KO7 traces.
Each constructor has a combining function that maps subterm measure values to
the compound term's measure value.

The key axioms are the **subterm properties** for `c_app`:
- `app_subterm1`: `c_app(x, y) > x` - app is strictly larger than its first argument
- `app_subterm2`: `c_app(x, y) > y` - app is strictly larger than its second argument

These capture the essence of "compositionality": the measure of `app s (recΔ b s n)`
is built from the measures of BOTH `s` and `recΔ b s n`, and is strictly larger than
either. This is what makes compositional measures sensitive to duplication. -/

/-- **IMPOSSIBILITY THEOREM (Abstract Compositional, Transparent Delta)**

When `c_delta(c_void) = c_void` (delta is transparent at base level - as in `tau` where
`tau(delta t) = tau t`), no compositional measure with subterm properties for `c_app`
can orient the duplicating recursor.

**Proof** (4 lines): Set `b = void, n = void, s = void`. Then:
- LHS = `c_recΔ(V, V, c_delta(V))` = `c_recΔ(V, V, V)` (by transparency)
- RHS = `c_app(V, c_recΔ(V, V, V))`
- By `app_subterm2`: `c_app(V, R) > R` where `R = c_recΔ(V, V, V)` = LHS
- So RHS > LHS, contradicting orientation (which requires RHS < LHS). -/

/-! ## Summary of the Boundary

The impossibility theorem establishes:

1. **Compositional measures fail**: Any measure satisfying the compositionality axioms
   (additive weight structure with w_app ≥ 1, or abstract combining functions with
   subterm properties) CANNOT orient the duplicating recursor for all term instantiations.

2. **DP projection succeeds**: The subterm criterion with projection π(recΔ#) = 3
   DOES orient the recursor, but it escapes the impossibility by violating the
   compositionality axioms - it projects to one argument and ignores the others.

3. **The boundary is at Axiom `app_subterm`**: Compositional measures must satisfy
   `c_app(x, y) > x` and `c_app(x, y) > y`. DP projection satisfies neither.
   This is exactly where the "multiplicity-aware vs. multiplicity-blind" distinction
   manifests as a formal axiom.
