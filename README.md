**CONJECTURE:** No relational operator-only TRS can have its full-system termination proved by internally definable methods.

**MAIN RESULT:** A mechanically-verified certified normalizer for a guarded fragment (`SafeStep`) using a novel triple-lexicographic measure.

This repository contains the Lean 4 formalization accompanying the paper above.

## Overview (what is proved vs what is conjectured)

KO7 is a minimal rewrite calculus with 7 constructors and 8 rules.

This repository formally verifies (Lean 4):
- **Safe fragment (`SafeStep`)**: strong normalization (SN) and a certified normalizer (total + sound).
- **Confluence (safe fragment)**: derived via Newman's lemma under the stated local-join condition.
- **Impossibility catalog**: machine-checked "no-go" witnesses showing why simpler measures fail under duplication.

This repository does **not** claim a proof of termination for the full kernel `Step` relation; that is the target of the conjecture above.

## Build Instructions

This repository is continuously built and verified via [GitHub Actions CI](https://github.com/MosesRahnama/OperatorKO7/actions/workflows/build.yml) (see badge above).

### Prerequisites
- [Lean 4](https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/setup.html) (version specified in `lean-toolchain`)
- Lake (Lean's build tool, included with Lean)

### Standard Build

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MosesRahnama/OperatorKO7.git
cd OperatorKO7

# Update dependencies
lake update

# Fetch mathlib cache (optional but recommended; significantly speeds up build)
lake exe cache get

# Build the project
lake build
```

### Minimal Build (without cache)

```bash
lake build
```

**Note:** Building without the mathlib cache may take 30-60 minutes depending on your system, as mathlib will be compiled from source.

## Reproducibility

To ensure exact reproducibility of the formalization presented in the paper:

- **Lean version:** `v4.22.0-rc4` (pinned in `lean-toolchain`)
- **Commit hash:** Use the tagged release `v1.0.0` (to be created upon journal submission)
- **Dependencies:** Locked in `lake-manifest.json`
- **Build verification:** Continuously tested on Ubuntu via GitHub Actions

### Verifying a Specific Release

```bash
# Clone and checkout the release tag
git clone https://github.com/MosesRahnama/OperatorKO7.git
cd OperatorKO7
git checkout v1.0.0  # Use the specific release tag

# Build as above
lake exe cache get
lake build
```

- **`LICENSE`**: Apache-2.0 license for the Lean code in this repository.
- **`.gitignore`**: Git ignore patterns (excludes build artifacts).
- **`lean-toolchain`**: pins the Lean toolchain version used to build the project.
- **`lakefile.lean`**: Lake package config (declares package/library `OperatorKO7`, depends on mathlib).
- **`lake-manifest.json`**: Lake dependency lockfile (generated by Lake).

### Paper
- **`Paper/Rahnama_KO7_Submission.pdf`**: paper source (includes direct link to this repo).
- **`Paper/LICENSE`**: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 legal code + notice for the paper text.

### Lean library (`OperatorKO7/`)
- **`OperatorKO7/Kernel.lean`**: defines `Trace` (7 constructors), the full kernel relation `Step` (8 unconditional rules), and `StepStar`.

### Lean meta-theory (`OperatorKO7/Meta/`)
- **`OperatorKO7/Meta/Termination.lean`**: ordinal/measure toolkit used by the termination development.

- **`OperatorKO7/Meta/ComputableMeasure.lean`**: a fully computable termination certificate for `SafeStep`.
- **`OperatorKO7/Meta/Normalize_Safe.lean`**: certified normalizer for `SafeStep` (total + sound; noncomputable by design).
- **`OperatorKO7/Meta/Newman_Safe.lean`**: Newman engine used to derive confluence for the safe fragment under local-join assumptions.
- **`OperatorKO7/Meta/Confluence_Safe.lean`**: local-join / critical-peak lemmas for the safe fragment; also includes an explicit full-kernel caveat showing the overlap at `eqW` creates a non-joinable peak.
- **`OperatorKO7/Meta/SafeStep_Ctx.lean`**: context-closure utilities for safe steps (used by join proofs).
- **`OperatorKO7/Meta/Impossibility_Lemmas.lean`**: impossibility lemmas supporting the conjecture narrative (failure witnesses for simpler measures).

- **`OperatorKO7/Meta/ContractProbes.lean`**: small auxiliary probes referenced by the impossibility story.
- **`OperatorKO7/Meta/DM_MPO_Orientation.lean`**: helper lemmas for DM/MPO orientations used in the measures.
- **`OperatorKO7/Meta/CNFOrdinal.lean`**: ordinal/CNF support (used by ordinal-based parts of the development).
- **`OperatorKO7/Meta/GoodsteinCore.lean`**: small, independent Goodstein-style toy core (exposition/witness support).
- **`OperatorKO7/Meta/HydraCore.lean`**: small, independent Hydra-style toy core (exposition/witness support).
- **`OperatorKO7/Meta/FailureModes.lean`**: negative tests / counterexample sketches documenting why naive reasoning fails (kept in the main tree as part of the theory story).
- **`OperatorKO7/Meta/ComputableMeasure_Test.lean`**: small Lean checks that the computable measure API is present (smoke tests).
- **`OperatorKO7/Meta/ComputableMeasure_Verification.lean`**: extra verification lemmas/examples for the computable measure (non-essential but kept for reproducibility).

### Lean tests (`OperatorKO7/Test/`)
- **`OperatorKO7/Test/Sanity.lean`**: minimal test file imported by the build to ensure the package compiles in CI and on fresh machines.
